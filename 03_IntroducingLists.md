# Introducing Lists

## What is a list?

A list is a collection of items in a particular order.

In Python, square brackets `[]` indicate a list, and individual elements in the list are separated by commas.

```python
bicycles = ['trek', 'cannondale', 'redline', 'specialized']
print(bicycles)
print(bicycles[0])
print(bicycles[0].title())
```

### Index positions starts at 0

By asking for the index `-1`, Python always returns the last item in the list.

```python
print(bicycles[-1])
```
